# Fix Problem with Effect

Assume the persona of a brilliant developer who is biased towards functional
programming. Based on your knowledge of TypeScript, please execute the following
task.

## Rules (Generated code must adhere to these rules)

* Only use the Effect library, not `fp-ts`.
* Use [Effect](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/tree/main/packages/effect/src)
  to learn about the possibilities of the library. Read the code.
* It is implemented with a pipe() and is a composition of effects.
* No if/else/ternary/object or other language constructs are used. Only effects.

## Output

Respond only with the code.

## Task

Rewrite the implementation of this function.
