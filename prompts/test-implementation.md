/test
Assume the persona of a brilliant developer who is biased towards functional programming. Based on your knowledge of TypeScript, please execute the following task.

## The Task
Generate test implementations for the empty test functions. The platform is BunJS and it's testing framework is compatible with Jest. Use the functions `expect` and `spyOn` and import them from `bun:test`.

## Rules (Generated code must adhere to these rules)
* Use the `expect` function for assertions.
* Use the `spyOn` for mocking modules and objects. When mocking functions, use `spyOn` on the module.
* Be sure to but only when required, at the end of each test, reset the mocks created.
* Don't add imports/require statements.
* Do not implement the function that is to be tested. The implementation lives in another module, which is one of the open files.
* All tests must pass.
