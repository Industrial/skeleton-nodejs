## Objective
Build a minimal trading platform inspired by Freqtrade, focusing on:
- **Tech**: CCXT, TypeScript, Bun.js.
- **Features**: Backtesting, hyperoptimization, live trading.
- **Design**: DDD for data modeling.
- **Performance**: Maximize CPU usage, minimize/shared memory.
- **Scalability**: Scale across cloud hardware to save time.

## Technology Stack
- **Language**: TypeScript – Ensures type safety and modern JavaScript features.
- **Runtime**: Bun.js – Offers high performance and native TypeScript support.
- **Trading API**: CCXT – Provides unified access to cryptocurrency exchanges.
- **Data Modeling**: DDD – Structures business logic and data effectively.

## Core Components
The platform is kept minimal with these essential components:
- **Exchange Service**: Interacts with exchanges via CCXT (e.g., fetching data, executing trades).
- **Data Service**: Handles historical and real-time market data (e.g., candlesticks).
- **Strategy Service**: Defines and runs trading strategies (e.g., buy/sell logic).
- **Backtesting Engine**: Simulates strategies on historical data.
- **Hyperoptimization Engine**: Optimizes strategy parameters.
- **Live Trading Engine**: Executes trades in real-time.
- **Event Bus**: Enables lightweight communication between components.

## Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
DDD ensures clear separation of business logic:
- **Domains**:
  - **Market Data**: Manages candlesticks, order books.
  - **Trading Strategies**: Encapsulates trading logic and indicators.
  - **Backtesting**: Handles simulation logic.
  - **Hyperoptimization**: Manages parameter tuning.
  - **Live Trading**: Oversees real-time execution.
- **Bounded Contexts**: Each domain operates independently to avoid overlap.
- **Entities**: Core objects like `Trade`, `Order`, `Position`.
- **Value Objects**: Immutable data like `Price`, `Volume`.

## Scalability and Resource Management
To maximize CPU and minimize memory while scaling across cloud hardware:
- **Microservices**: Each component is a separate microservice, deployable independently.
- **Event-Driven**: An event bus (e.g., Redis or Kafka) enables asynchronous communication, reducing memory overhead.
- **Shared Memory**: Redis caches shared data (e.g., market data, strategy parameters) to avoid duplication.
- **CPU Optimization**: Worker threads or child processes handle CPU-intensive tasks (e.g., backtesting, hyperoptimization).

## Backtesting and Hyperoptimization
- **Backtesting Engine**:
  - Uses historical data from the Data Service.
  - Simulates trades based on strategy logic.
  - Runs in parallel across CPU cores using worker threads for efficiency.
- **Hyperoptimization Engine**:
  - Implements algorithms like grid search or genetic algorithms.
  - Distributes tasks across cloud instances for faster processing.
  - Stores results in shared memory (e.g., Redis) to avoid redundant work.

## Live Trading
- **Live Trading Engine**:
  - Subscribes to real-time data via CCXT WebSockets.
  - Executes trades based on strategy signals.
  - Includes risk and order management.
- **Memory Efficiency**:
  - Processes data streams to avoid large in-memory datasets.
  - Shares market data via the event bus.

## Cloud Deployment and Scaling
- **Containerization**: Docker packages each microservice.
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes manages and scales containers across cloud hardware.
- **Load Balancing**: Evenly distributes tasks and requests.
- **Auto-Scaling**: Adjusts resources based on CPU usage for cost-effective performance.

## Data Flow and Communication
- **Event Bus**: Publishes/subscribes to events (e.g., new data, trade signals).
- **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ distributes tasks for backtesting and hyperoptimization.
- **Shared Cache**: Redis stores frequently accessed data efficiently.

## Security and Reliability
- **API Keys**: Stored securely (e.g., environment variables, secrets manager).
- **Error Handling**: Robust logging and recovery across services.
- **Monitoring**: Tools like Prometheus and Grafana track performance and usage.

## Summary
This architecture uses:
- **DDD** for structured data and logic.
- **Microservices** and an **event-driven approach** for scalability and minimal memory usage.
- **Bun.js/TypeScript** for performance and type safety.
- **Parallel processing** and **cloud scaling** to maximize CPU power.

It starts minimal yet scales efficiently across cloud hardware, saving time and optimizing resources. You can begin with a single instance and expand as needed, leveraging shared memory and distributed computing for backtesting, hyperoptimization, and live trading.
