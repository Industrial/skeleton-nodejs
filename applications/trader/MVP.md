# MVP.md: Backtesting-Only System with CCXT and NATS

## Objective
This document outlines the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for a backtesting system based on the query:
*"Take the generated markdown code and envision a MVP that only implements the bare minimum. We are going for Backtesting only using CCXT to grab data from a CEX and we are going to use NATS to provide messaging capabilities to reach multi-core processing. I want you to use DDD to design a system and lay out the integral parts to do this."*
The MVP focuses on:
- **Tech**: CCXT for data retrieval, NATS for multi-core messaging.
- **Feature**: Backtesting only.
- **Design**: DDD to structure the system logically and modularly.

## Scope
The MVP delivers the essentials for backtesting:
- Retrieve historical data from a CEX using CCXT.
- Process trading strategy simulations on this data across multiple CPU cores using NATS for task distribution.

## Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Structure
Using DDD, the system is split into distinct domains with clear responsibilities, entities, and value objects. This ensures modularity and maintainability.

### Domains

1. **Market Data Domain**
   - **Purpose**: Handles retrieval and management of historical market data from the CEX.
   - **Entities**:
     - `Candlestick`: Represents a single OHLCV (open, high, low, close, volume) data point with a timestamp.
   - **Value Objects**:
     - `Price`: A numeric value representing a price level.
     - `Volume`: A numeric value for trade volume.
     - `Timestamp`: A point in time for the candlestick.
   - **Bounded Context**: Focused solely on data retrieval; provides data to the Backtesting Domain via a defined interface.

2. **Backtesting Domain**
   - **Purpose**: Manages the simulation of trading strategies using historical data.
   - **Entities**:
     - `Trade`: A single buy or sell action with price, volume, and timestamp.
     - `Position`: Tracks an open trade’s state (e.g., entry price, size).
     - `BacktestResult`: Summary of the simulation (e.g., profit/loss, win rate).
   - **Value Objects**:
     - `StrategyParameters`: Configuration for the trading strategy (e.g., thresholds, periods).
     - `PerformanceMetrics`: Calculated results like total return or Sharpe ratio.
   - **Bounded Context**: Consumes data from the Market Data Domain and strategy logic from the Strategy Domain.

3. **Strategy Domain**
   - **Purpose**: Defines the trading strategy logic for backtesting.
   - **Entities**:
     - `Strategy`: Encapsulates the rules for generating buy/sell signals.
   - **Value Objects**:
     - `Indicator`: A calculated value (e.g., moving average) used in the strategy.
     - `Signal`: A buy or sell instruction generated by the strategy.
   - **Bounded Context**: Supplies strategy logic to the Backtesting Domain; independent of data or simulation mechanics.

### Integral Parts

1. **CCXT Service**
   - **Role**: Fetches historical candlestick data from a CEX.
   - **Domain**: Market Data Domain.
   - **Description**: Uses the CCXT library to query a CEX (e.g., Binance) for candlestick data based on a symbol (e.g., BTC/USDT) and timeframe (e.g., 1h).
   - **Output**: A list of `Candlestick` entities passed to the Backtesting Engine.

2. **NATS Service**
   - **Role**: Facilitates messaging for distributing backtesting tasks across CPU cores.
   - **Domain**: Cross-cutting; primarily supports the Backtesting Domain.
   - **Description**: Implements a publish-subscribe model to send tasks to workers and collect results. Ensures efficient, low-latency communication.
   - **Usage**: Backtesting Engine publishes tasks; workers subscribe and respond.

3. **Backtesting Engine**
   - **Role**: Orchestrates the backtesting process.
   - **Domain**: Backtesting Domain.
   - **Description**:
     - Receives historical data from the CCXT Service and strategy logic from the Strategy Service.
     - Splits data into chunks (e.g., by time range) for parallel processing.
     - Uses NATS to distribute tasks to workers and aggregates their results into a `BacktestResult`.
   - **Key Function**: Coordinates multi-core simulation and computes final metrics.

4. **Strategy Service**
   - **Role**: Provides the trading strategy for simulation.
   - **Domain**: Strategy Domain.
   - **Description**: Defines a simple strategy (e.g., “buy when price crosses above a moving average, sell when it falls below”). Exposes the `Strategy` entity with its logic to the Backtesting Engine.
   - **Output**: `Signal` objects based on input data and `StrategyParameters`.

5. **Worker Processes**
   - **Role**: Execute backtesting tasks on individual CPU cores.
   - **Domain**: Backtesting Domain.
   - **Description**:
     - Subscribe to NATS for tasks (e.g., “simulate this data chunk with this strategy”).
     - Process the chunk by applying the strategy, generating `Trade` and `Position` entities.
     - Return partial results (e.g., profit/loss for the chunk) to the Backtesting Engine via NATS.

## System Flow
Here's how the MVP operates:
1. **Data Retrieval**:
   - CCXT Service pulls historical candlestick data from the CEX.
   - Data is sent to the Backtesting Engine.
2. **Task Distribution**:
   - Backtesting Engine divides the data into chunks and pairs each with `StrategyParameters`.
   - Publishes tasks to NATS.
3. **Parallel Processing**:
   - Worker Processes pick up tasks from NATS.
   - Each worker simulates the strategy on its data chunk, producing partial results.
4. **Result Aggregation**:
   - Workers send results back through NATS.
   - Backtesting Engine combines them into a final `BacktestResult`.

## Multi-Core Processing with NATS
- **Approach**: NATS distributes tasks to workers running on separate cores, enabling parallel simulation.
- **Benefit**: Speeds up backtesting by leveraging all available CPU resources.
- **Design**: Workers are lightweight and stateless, processing only their assigned chunk.

## Implementation Notes
- **Tech Stack**: Use TypeScript for type safety and a runtime like Bun.js or Node.js.
- **Data Size**: Keep chunks manageable to avoid memory overload while minimizing NATS messaging overhead.
- **Simplicity**: Start with a basic strategy (e.g., moving average crossover) to validate the system.

## Summary
This MVP delivers a backtesting-only system with:
- **CCXT**: For fetching CEX data.
- **NATS**: For multi-core task distribution.
- **DDD**: To organize the Market Data, Backtesting, and Strategy Domains.
It’s a lean, functional foundation that meets the query’s requirements while remaining extensible for future enhancements.
