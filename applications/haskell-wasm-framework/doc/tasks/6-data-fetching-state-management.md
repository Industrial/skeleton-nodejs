# Task 6: Develop Data Fetching and State Management Mechanism

Description: Create a mechanism for fetching data from APIs and managing state within the application. This system should work both on the client (using WASM) and server (using BunJS).

Acceptance Criteria:
  - Implement a data fetching utility in Haskell that can make HTTP requests to external APIs.
  - Create a simple state management module to manage application state across components.
  - Ensure that data fetching logic is reusable for both server-side and client-side rendering.
  - Implement a demo feature that fetches data from a mock API and displays it in a Haskell-based view.
  - Test the data fetching and state management to verify it works consistently across client and server.
