# Task 2: Implement Basic Routing System

Description: Develop a basic routing system to handle different routes for both client-side and server-side rendering. The routing system should be able to distinguish between static and dynamic routes.

Acceptance Criteria:
  - A simple routing module is created in Haskell that can define static routes (e.g., /about) and dynamic routes (e.g., /user/:id).
  - The routing system supports route matching and dispatching for both server-side and client-side contexts.
  - Basic route handling logic is tested and works for simple endpoints.
  - The routing system is compatible with BunJS and runs on the server, rendering the correct response based on the route.
